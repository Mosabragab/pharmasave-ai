## Introduction

This document outlines the comprehensive brand guidelines for PharmaSave AI. These guidelines ensure consistent representation of our brand across all platforms and communications. Adherence to these standards is essential for maintaining a cohesive and professional brand identity.

## Brand Story

We empower pharmacists to reduce waste, connect with peers, and improve their bottom line through an AI-enhanced platform.

Our brand reflects the intersection of healthcare professionalism and cutting-edge technology, creating a platform that is both trustworthy and forward-thinking.

## Core Values

Our brand identity is built on five fundamental values that guide all aspects of our design and communication:

* **Sustainability:** Reducing pharmaceutical waste for a healthier planet. This commitment to environmental responsibility is reflected in our green-focused color palette and emphasis on waste reduction.

* **Community:** Connecting pharmacists to foster collaboration and mutual support. Our platform facilitates meaningful connections between professionals, creating a network that benefits all participants.

* **Financial Responsibility:** Helping pharmacies save money and increase profits. Our focus on economic benefits drives our practical, value-driven approach to design and communication.

* **Innovation:** Utilizing AI to enhance user experience and operational efficiency. Our integration of advanced technology is reflected in modern, clean design elements and forward-thinking messaging.

## Logo

The PharmaSave AI logo is the primary visual identifier of our brand. It symbolizes the intersection of pharmaceutical industry and artificial intelligence technology.

### Logo Elements

* **Pill Icon:** A simple, stylized pill outline in Pharmacy Green (#1E8A6E) positioned to the left of the text. The pill has rounded ends and a clean, minimal design with consistent line weight.
* **Wordmark:** The "PharmaSave" text appears in black with a modern, sans-serif font that conveys professionalism and clarity.
* **AI Element:** The "AI" text appears in Pharmacy Green (#1E8A6E) and is positioned as a subscript beneath the "PharmaSave" text, creating a balanced, cohesive lockup.
* **Composition:** The elements are aligned vertically, with the center of the pill icon aligning with the center height of the wordmark.
* **Proportions:** The pill icon is approximately 75% of the height of the wordmark, creating a balanced visual relationship.

### Logo Variations

1. **Primary Logo:** Full-color version for use on white or light backgrounds
2. **Reverse Logo:** White version for use on dark backgrounds
3. **Monochrome Logo:** Single-color version for limited color applications
4. **Icon Only:** The pill symbol alone for favicons and small applications

### Clear Space

Always maintain minimum clear space around the logo equal to the height of the "P" in "PharmaSave" to ensure visual impact and legibility. The clear space should be measured from the outermost edges of the pill icon on the left and the wordmark on the right.

### Minimum Size

* Digital: Minimum width of 120px for the full logo
* Print: Minimum width of 1 inch for the full logo
* Icon Only: Minimum width of 24px digital, 0.25 inches print

* Do not stretch or distort the logo or change the proportions between elements
* Do not rearrange elements of the logo or change their spatial relationship
* Do not add effects (shadows, gradients, outlines) to any part of the logo
* Do not place the logo on busy backgrounds that reduce visibility or contrast

## Bilingual Implementation Guidelines

### RTL Layout Considerations

* **Line Height**: Increase line height by 10% for Arabic text to accommodate taller letter forms

### Bilingual UI Components

* **Dropdowns**: Open to the right side in Arabic interfaces
* **Navigation**: Mirror navigation order and icon placement in RTL layouts
* **Search Fields**: Position search icon on the left side in Arabic interfaces

### Language Switching

* **Seamless Transitions**: UI adapts to the appropriate layout without requiring page refresh
* **Persistent Settings**: Language preference is saved to user profile
* **Accessible Toggle**: Language selector is consistently positioned in the header/footer
* **Visual Indicator**: Current language is clearly indicated
