-- Example 2: Delete a specific archived pharmacy (REPLACE pharmacy_id_here)
-- SELECT delete_archived_pharmacy('pharmacy_id_here', 'CONFIRM_DELETE_PERMANENTLY');

-- Example 3: Clean up archives older than 1 year
-- SELECT cleanup_old_archives(365, 'CONFIRM_BULK_CLEANUP');

-- Example 4: Get archive statistics
SELECT get_archive_statistics() as archive_stats;

-- 6. GRANT PERMISSIONS
